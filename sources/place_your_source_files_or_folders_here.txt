# Sources Directory

Place your source files and folders in this directory for copying to the system.

The copy_dirs.sh script will copy configured directories from here to their target locations.

Examples of directories/files you might place here:
- fonts/ (custom fonts to be copied to ~/.fonts)
- icons/ (custom icons to be copied to ~/.icons)  
- launchers/ (custom .desktop files to be copied to ~/.local/share/applications)
- home/ (files to be copied to home directory)
- themes/ (custom themes)
- wallpapers/ (custom wallpapers)

Configure the copy operations in config.sh using the COPY_PATHS array.

Note: This placeholder file will be ignored by git, but the actual files/folders you place here will also be ignored to avoid committing personal files to the repository.
