# DEB Files Directory

Place your local .deb files in this directory for installation.

The install_apps.sh script will automatically detect and install any .deb files found here.

Examples of files you might place here:
- google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
- discord-0.0.xx.deb
- custom-application.deb

Note: This placeholder file will be ignored by git, but the actual .deb files you place here will also be ignored to avoid committing large binary files to the repository.
